                    Hi, I am a PhD candidate under the supervision of 
                    <a href="https://joaquinvanschoren.github.io/home/" target="_blank">Joaquin Vanschoren</a> 
                    at the department of Mathematics and Computer Science

                <h2>Research Interests</h2>

                <p>Deep Learning, Continual Learning, Computer Vision.</p>

                <p> 
                    <b>In our ever-evolving world, each day brings new adventures and opportunities where we learn from them and build
                        our knowledge on top of our prior experiences.  Just as we humans continually learn, adapt, and grow from our past experiences,
                        we aspire for AI to do the same—to evolve and improve with each new piece of knowledge it acquires 
                        of course by remembering what it has learned. Continual learning in AI is not just a pursuit; 
                        it's a foundational goal driving ongoing research endeavors. Personally, I'm deeply intrigued by the 
                        challenge of teaching AI to retain its previous knowledge while eagerly learning new insights—a challenge 
                        that's still buzzing with excitement among scientists. If you also think this is something exciting and want
                        to discuss more, I'd love to chat more about it!  I warmly invite you to reach out for engaging conversations.
                </p>
